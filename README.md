# Introduction

In this repository you find an implementation of a multi-purpose Model Predictive Controller. The controller was implemented as a contribution to the [Automatic Control Project Course (EL2425)](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/EL2425) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. 
The developed algorithm was tested on a 1:10 RC car provided by KTH Smart Mobility Lab. The test scenarios comprised the following three tasks:

1. Reference Path Tracking
2. Time-Optimal Driving
3. Obstacle Avoidance
